# ChitChat
This is a social forum, which I like to think of kinda like Whisper/Secret with subreddits

This app might not work right off the bat if you fork the repo since Parse app keys etc aren't included here

Shoot me a note if you want me to provide details about the noSQL schema or free to reverse engineer it so you can
create your own app on Parse to play around with this if you fancy

Word of advice - please don't spam requests since Parse has a limited free tier (I think it caps at 30 qps)

Finally, I'm pretty proud of assets and color schemes since I did all of it by myself. If anyone has feedback or
suggestions for improvement, I'm all ears. Thanks for reading this far, ily.
